## A blog? For me? Oh damn!

**Hello All,**

Welcome to my first blog post where i post whatever whenever.
Spent a little bit of time building this static blog with NextJS and MDX.
It's been a fun experience so far and i'm looking forward to writing more posts.

I've made some componenets to make it easier to write posts.

<div className="mb-5">
  <u>I made the following componenets:</u>
</div>

<Info>This is a warning.</Info>

```tsx
Code block
```

```tsx {1} title="index.js" caption="Cool caption" showLineNumbers /Word/#v /highlights/#s /and/#i
"Code block with title, caption,"
"Word highlights and line numbers"
"Courtesy of rehypePrettyCode plugin"
"And a custom copy code button"
```

  <em className="m-0">Tokyo cityscape</em>
</div>
