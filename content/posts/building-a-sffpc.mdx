## What is a SFFPC

A Small Form Factor PC (**SFFPC**) is a computer that is smaller than a traditional desktop computer.
Using compact components, these computers are designed to be portable and take up less space than a full-sized desktop.
They are often used for gaming, media streaming, and other tasks that require a powerful computer in a small package.

## Why Small Form Factor?

I value portability and space-saving in my life and i wasn't planning to play the latest AAA games on ultra settings.
I really like when things can be made compact and stay versitile at the same time.
What i wanted was these three things:

- Backpackable
- Off the shelf components
- Good performance
- Quiet
- Good looking

I got a sketchy power supply from my aliexpress vendor so i got a refund and bought from a better seller on Taobao using a proxy service.

![psu swap](/images/blog/building-a-sffpc/11.jpg "Enhance Flex 700W PSU ENP-7760B (modular)")

I made the decision to buy a high wattage PSU for limiting the heat and noise of the PSU fan. At 700w it's a bit overkill for my less that 300w build but it's a good quality 
PSU and i can upgrade the GPU in the future without changing the PSU. Especially useful for the next gen Nvidia GPUs that chug power like crazy.
I have recently thought about swapping it out for a solid state PSU like the [HDPLEX 400/500w](https://hdplex.com/) for a quieter build but i heard about shut-offs and overheating problems.
For now i'm happy with the Enhance Flex PSU, maybe for my next build i'll go for a solid state one.

## Making the build quiet

### CPU fan

As this is my first pc build i had no experience with fan noise levels, only seeing [linustechtips](https://www.youtube.com/user/linustechtips) videos about diffrent cooling fan brands and models.
My first low profile cooler was the Cryorig C7 cooler and although i really loved the RGB and this was the main purchase reason, but it ended up being lounder than i expected, expecialy with the fact that the pc 
would sit on my desk right next to my ears. I decided to swap the cooler for the Noctua NH-L9a-AM4 chromax black cooler. A very popular cooler in the SFFPC community for it's low profile and quietness, and this 
change alone make a world of diffrence.

### GPU fan

This one was a bit more tricky. The gpu fan was loud and i wanted to swap it for a Noctua fan as i had seen some people pull it off on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/wsuefh/noctua_gpu_fan_msi_rtx_3060_aero_itx/)
where they seemed to have chopped up a nocta NF A9x14 and jerry rigged it into the shroud with an addapted for the fan header and no performance impact.
So i got to work ruinned a perfect fan on my first attempt but got it perfect on the second and voila, a much quieter gpu.
