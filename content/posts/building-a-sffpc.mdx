## What is a SFFPC

A Small Form Factor PC (**SFFPC**) is a computer that is smaller than a traditional desktop computer. Using compact components, these
computers are designed to be portable and take up less space than a full-sized desktop. They are often used for gaming, media streaming, and
other tasks that require a powerful computer in a small package.

## Why Small Form Factor?

I value portability and space-saving in my life and I wasn't planning to play the latest AAA games on ultra settings. I really like when
things can be made compact and stay versitile at the same time. What I wanted was these three things:

- Backpackable
- Off the shelf components
- Good performance
- Quiet
- Good looking

I got a sketchy power supply from my aliexpress vendor so I got a refund and bought from a better seller on Taobao using a proxy service
because it's a chinese site and I needed to ship it to Europe.

![psu swap](/images/blog/building-a-sffpc/11.jpg "Enhance Flex 700W PSU ENP-7760B (modular)")

I made the decision to buy a high wattage PSU for limiting the heat and noise of the PSU fan. At 700w it's a bit overkill for my less that
300w build but it's a good quality PSU and I can upgrade the GPU in the future without changing the PSU. Especially useful for the next gen
Nvidia GPUs that chug power like crazy. I have recently thought about swapping it out for a solid state PSU like the
[HDPLEX 400/500w](https://hdplex.com/) for a quieter build but I heard about shut-offs and overheating problems. For now i'm happy with the
Enhance Flex PSU, maybe for my next build i'll go for a solid state one.

## Making the build quiet

### PSU

![psu fan swap](/images/blog/building-a-sffpc/32.jpg "Swapping the PSU fan to a noctua one")

So for the PSU I decided to swap out the fan for a noctua one because those types of small fans especially cheap ones can have a very high
pitches sound. I had originally ordered my first PSU unit with preswapped 4x20 noctua fans for better noice performance. And when it died I
just harvested it and put it on my new unit. This new unit was not black color thus ruinning the asthetic... oh well you win some you lose
some...

### CPU fan

![Cryorig cpu cooler](/images/blog/building-a-sffpc/sffpc.png "Cryorig cpu cooler")

![Noctua cpu cooler](/images/blog/building-a-sffpc/18.jpg "Noctua cpu cooler")

As this is my first pc build I had no experience with fan noise levels, only seeing
[linustechtips](https://www.youtube.com/user/linustechtips) videos about different cooling fan brands and models. My first low profile
cooler was the Cryorig C7 cooler and although I really loved the RGB and this was the main purchase reason, but it ended up being lounder
than I expected, expecialy with the fact that the pc would sit on my desk right next to my ears. I decided to swap the cooler for the Noctua
NH-L9a-AM4 chromax black cooler. A very popular cooler in the SFFPC community for it's low profile and quietness, and this change alone make
a world of diffrence.

### GPU fan

![GPU Noctua fan swap](/images/blog/building-a-sffpc/16.jpg "GPU Noctua fan swap")

This one was a bit more tricky. The gpu fan was loud and I wanted to swap it for a Noctua fan as I had seen some people pull it off on
reddit like in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/wsuefh/noctua_gpu_fan_msi_rtx_3060_aero_itx/) post where they seemed to have
chopped up a nocta NF A9x14 and jerry rigged it into the shroud with an addapted for the fan header and no performance impact. So I got to
work ruinned a perfect fan on my first attempt but got it perfect on the second and voila, a much quieter gpu.

## Customisation

### Front panel IO

As there was no front panel IO on the K39 V2 case I had to make my own. I drilled some holes in the front panel to accomodate the IO and
created a 3D printed bracket for some USB-A ports I found on aliexpress because they were not flush with the case, I also make sure they
were thin enough for a bracket, the case is quite tight afterall. The USB-C port didn't need modification just some holes for the screws. I
also drilled a hole for a push button to power the pc on and off because the one from the case was on the back, didn't like that very much
plus my one looks super cool. Don't mind the black vinyle I had to hide the scratches from my awful cutting skills.

## Conclusion

![Using the pc](/images/blog/building-a-sffpc/33.jpg "Using the pc")

I'm very happy with the build and it's been running great. It performs well for most games, no overheating. The noice that it does make is
very low pitch and with headphones I hear nothing. I've been able to travel with it in my backpack and set it up in no time. I'll get a
portable display for it too soon. Hopefully I'll upgrade the GPU to a 40 series Itx card when I can afford it and I have ambissions for an
even smaller pc build.

Thanks for reading!
